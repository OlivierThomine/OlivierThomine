## Upcoming Data Projects

These are personal projects I am currently working on to prepare for my **Data Science certification**. They cover a wide range of skills from data engineering to machine learning and MLOps.

### **Kayak** – Cloud Data Ingestion & Storage
Automated collection of weather and hotel data via APIs and web scraping. Storage on **AWS S3** and **PostgreSQL**, visualized on an interactive map.

### **Steam Analytics** – Distributed Big Data Analysis
Processing of semi-structured data using **PySpark** on **Databricks**. Advanced segmentation analysis, S3 storage, and dashboard visualizations.

### **Conversion Rate Prediction**
Modeling user newsletter sign-up predictions using **Scikit-learn** with hyperparameter tuning and marketing insights.

### **Uber Demand Hot-Zones**
Geospatial clustering (**KMeans**, **DBScan**) to identify high-demand pickup areas in NYC, visualized with Plotly.

### **AT&T Spam Detection**
Spam classification using Deep Learning with **PyTorch** and NLP. Fine-tuned pre-trained models to enhance performance.

### **Getaround ML API**
Dynamic pricing model for car rentals, deployed via **Streamlit**, **FastAPI**, and monitored with **MLflow** and **Hugging Face**.

### **Final Project** – Real Estate & Climate Impact
End-to-end solution predicting real estate prices affected by climate risks. Built with FastAPI, Streamlit, MLflow tracking, and deployed using Docker.

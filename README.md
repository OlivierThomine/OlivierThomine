## 🚀 Upcoming Data Projects

These are personal projects I am currently working on to prepare for my **Data Science certification**. They cover a wide range of skills from data engineering to machine learning and MLOps.

### ☀️ 1. **Kayak** – Cloud Data Ingestion & Storage
Automated collection of weather and hotel data via APIs and web scraping. Storage on AWS S3 and PostgreSQL, visualized on an interactive map.

### 🎮 2. **Steam Analytics** – Distributed Big Data Analysis
Processing of semi-structured data using PySpark on Databricks. Advanced segmentation analysis, S3 storage, and dashboard visualizations.

### 💬 3. **Tinder** – Speed-Dating Data Exploration
Statistical analysis of speed-dating data to identify key factors influencing mutual interest and second dates. Visualizations with Plotly and Matplotlib.

### 🛒 4. **Walmart – Sales Forecasting**
Weekly sales prediction using supervised models (Random Forest, LightGBM). Focus on seasonality, feature engineering, and business-driven evaluation.

### 📈 5. **Conversion Rate Prediction**
Modeling user newsletter sign-up predictions using Scikit-learn with hyperparameter tuning and marketing insights.

### 🚕 6. **Uber Demand Hot-Zones**
Geospatial clustering (KMeans, DBScan) to identify high-demand pickup areas in NYC, visualized with Plotly.

### 📩 7. **AT&T Spam Detection**
Spam classification using Deep Learning with PyTorch and NLP. Fine-tuned pre-trained models to enhance performance.

### ⚙️ 8. **Getaround ML API**
Dynamic pricing model for car rentals, deployed via Streamlit, FastAPI, and monitored with MLflow and Hugging Face.

### 🏡 9. **Final Project** – Real Estate & Climate Impact
End-to-end solution predicting real estate prices affected by climate risks. Built with FastAPI, Streamlit, MLflow tracking, and deployed using Docker.
